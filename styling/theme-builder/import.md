# Importing a Theme

[Progress ThemeBuilder for ASP.NET AJAX](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax) allows you to upload and import a theme that you previously created so you can modify it further. 

1. Open [ThemeBuilder](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax).

1. Select **Import Theme**.

   <img src="images/themebuilder-import-theme.png" alt="Import Theme button in ThemeBuilder" width="145"/>

1. Provide the `theme-name.json` file that is included in the downloaded ZIP package with the theme.

Once you have uploaded the theme, you can customize it as described in the [Creating a Theme]({%slug theme-builder/create%}) article.
