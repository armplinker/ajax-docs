# Overview

This article lists the client-side API of **RadStepper** and shows how to use it.

To use the API, you must first [get a reference to the control's client-side object]({%slug general-information/get-client-side-reference%}). For example:

````JavaScript
var stepper = $find("<%=RadStepper1.ClientID %>");
````

RadStepper is a server-side wrapper over the Kendo UI Stepper Widget. Thus, it exposes [the API of the underlying Kendo widget](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/stepper). To get a reference to the Kendo widget instance, you can do either of the following:

* Use the `get_kendoWidget()` method of the MS AJAX wrapper:

    **JavaScript**

        var stepperObject  = $find("<%=RadStepper1.ClientID %>"); //the standard script control object
        var kendoStepper = stepperObject.get_kendoWidget(); //the Kendo widget


* Get the Kendo Widget in its usual way. Make sure to use the `$telerik.$` jQuery reference:

    **JavaScript**
    
        var kendoStepper = $telerik.$("#<%=RadStepper1.ClientID %>").data("kendoStepper"); 


In addition to using the Kendo methods directly, you can also use their wrappers that follow the MS AJAX convention through the RadStepper client object.
